# The Psychic game

## Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.
## When the player wins, Wins is increased and the game is started over again (without refreshing the page).
## When the player loses, Losses is increased and the game is restarted without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
